Small example that uses a WebGl to render many points and lines.

Basically it uses the OL default shaders for this but adapts the one for points to use a SDF to look like a point instead of a rectangle.
This technique can also be used to make the lines look like arrows.

# running

```sh
npm install
npm run serve
```
